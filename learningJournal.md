| Class01|Today I learned or relearned using my terminal and VS code. Its been two years since I took 201/301 and since I hadnt put the previous learnings to use I had forgotten how to do such things. Its coming back little by little.|I learned HTML and CSS in college but it didnt make sense. Then Myspace came out and because I could see the outcome of my code changes it started to click for me. Over time ive learned bits and pieces of things such as VBA, SQL, Python(barely anything) and i think that has created a understanding of how code and code structure was created and with what intentions. SO that helps me as a basis on learning and associating what I already know into what im learning now. |
| Class02|Today we learned about conditional statements which are very tricky at first unless you have experience with another language such as SQL or python which also use similar conditionals.|Conditional statements are actually quite common in a few languages. I feel like in any programming language a conditional statement is key to ensuring that the program runs the way you want it to. Ive used them quite a bit. |
