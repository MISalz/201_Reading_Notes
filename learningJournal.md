| Class01|Today I learned or relearned using my terminal and VS code. Its been two years since I took 201/301 and since I hadnt put the previous learnings to use I had forgotten how to do such things. Its coming back little by little.|I learned HTML and CSS in college but it didnt make sense. Then Myspace came out and because I could see the outcome of my code changes it started to click for me. Over time ive learned bits and pieces of things such as VBA, SQL, Python(barely anything) and i think that has created a understanding of how code and code structure was created and with what intentions. SO that helps me as a basis on learning and associating what I already know into what im learning now. |
| Class02|Today we learned about conditional statements which are very tricky at first unless you have experience with another language such as SQL or python which also use similar conditionals.|Conditional statements are actually quite common in a few languages. I feel like in any programming language a conditional statement is key to ensuring that the program runs the way you want it to. Ive used them quite a bit. |

| Class04|Today I learned about Functions and CSS positioning. I forgot about functions and am excited to use them. |I feel like pair programming is so important for all job types. Ive actually have to work with clients and walk them through instruction and this exercise definitely has come in hand. I feel like im going to use this experience alot in my future.|
| Class05|Today we learned in class about Images, and css sytling to ensure your page is reactive. Git branching which I will definately need to remember how to do this. |I took these courses two years ago and even the little that i learned helped me in my las job. I was able to be objective and understand how the IT and development teams worked and why sometimes our sites break. |
